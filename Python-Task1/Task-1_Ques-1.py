#Task1
#Question-1: Write a program in Python which would include some code working with integers and float variables.
# I will use integer(radius) and float(pi) variables to find the area of circle.

def area_of_circle(radius,pi):
    area=pi*radius*radius
    return area
print(area_of_circle(2,3.14))    # radius is taken as integer and pi is float value
